Here is a factory that manufactures bags. There are almost 100 production lines, and there are more than 1,000 factory employees. Among them, there are more than 100 managers and many supervisors. How do we get real-time confirmation that so many factory employees are doing their process well?

##### THE PROBLEM

###### There is not any managing technology system for the factories, the employees just have been worked through the documents

The management system was not properly established, so managers and supervisors had to print out their employees' work status in documents at that time, receive them, and seach and read many complicated working process one by one.

Advertisements size management can also be done, and ad exposure time and availability can also be managed.

Conveniently check out lists of advertisements which an admin was added at once.

What if the clients require to question about managing the dashboard, they can upload inquiry on the board page. Then the dashboard admin as a developer can respond immediately.

##### FINAL DESIGN

In adKnowva admin, a developer can also manage advertisement information as well as merchant lists by adding clients and advertisements. As a result, developers and clients applied the same interaction flow and user interface solutions for profit management.
