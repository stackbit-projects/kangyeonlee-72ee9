Here is a factory that manufactures bags. There are almost 100 production lines, and there are more than 1,000 factory employees. Among them, there are more than 100 managers and many supervisors. How do we get real-time confirmation that so many factory employees are doing their process well?

##### THE PROBLEM

###### There is not any managing technology system for the factories, the employees just have been worked through the documents

The management system was not properly established, so managers and supervisors had to print out their employees' work status in documents at that time, receive them, and seach and read many complicated working process one by one.
