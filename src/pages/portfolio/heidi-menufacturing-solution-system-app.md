##### PROJECT OVERVIEW

### How could make the working process speed up a little more

![](/images/overview-1.png)

Here is a factory that manufactures bags. There are almost 100 production lines, and there are more than 1,000 factory employees. Among them, there are more than 100 managers and many supervisors. How do we get real-time confirmation that so many factory employees are doing their process well?

##### THE PROBLEM

###### Most of the factory employees receive their work process in paper documents

Ordinary employees were even receiving information from supervisor or manager-level employees in paper documents, and it was necessary to classify information that they did not require.

##### GOAL

I identified below things I could do to design the app.

###### 1. Optimize the UI to help employees quickly find each process of each section

**2. Enhance the UI and visual style to improve the readability and brand identity**

##### THE SOLUTION

### Designing comfortable to usable app

Most of the factory employees receive their work process in paper documents. Accordingly, I design an intuitive dashboard app that is comfortable to use for employees who are not familiar with the app system.

##### THE PROCESS

### Design that clearly appears only the features employees require

My goal at ad Knowva was totally simplified to all control together on the dashboard.

Advertisements size management can also be done, and ad exposure time and availability can also be managed.

Conveniently check out lists of advertisements which an admin was added at once.

Keep track of advertisements' exposure time can be managed and check out the monthly profit.

What if the clients require to question about managing the dashboard, they can upload inquiry on the board page. Then the dashboard admin as a developer can respond immediately.

##### FINAL DESIGN

In adKnowva admin, a developer can also manage advertisement information as well as merchant lists by adding clients and advertisements. As a result, developers and clients applied the same interaction flow and user interface solutions for profit management.
