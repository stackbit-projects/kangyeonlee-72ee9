##### PROJECT OVERVIEW

### How could make the working process speed up a little more

![](/images/overview-1.png)

Here is a factory that manufactures bags. There are almost 100 production lines, and there are more than 1,000 factory employees. Among them, there are more than 100 managers and many supervisors. How do we get real-time confirmation that so many factory employees are doing their process well?

##### THE PROBLEM

###### Most of the factory employees receive their work process in paper documents

Ordinary employees were even receiving information from supervisor or manager-level employees in paper documents, and it was necessary to classify information that they did not require.

##### GOAL

I identified below things I could do to design the app.

###### 1. Optimize the UI to help employees quickly find each process of each section

**2. Enhance the UI and visual style to improve the readability and brand identity**

##### THE SOLUTION

### Designing comfortable to usable app

Most of the factory employees receive their work process in paper documents. Accordingly, I design an intuitive dashboard app that is comfortable to use for employees who are not familiar with the app system.
