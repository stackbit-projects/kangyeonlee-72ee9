##### THE PROBLEM

###### 1. Even if it's the same advertisement, the size and number of advertisements are different for each mobile device

###### 2. Difficult to distinguish what size of advertisements from each client request

When managing the advertisements, in the existing system, there was difficulty distinguishing advertisement which is from each client. Each client provides various advertisements. Additionally, the resolution sizes of mobile devices vary widely, requiring distinction of data from advertising management by size and client-specific to profit aggregation.
