##### THE PROBLEM

###### 1. An introduction to the direction of the company and an efficient description of the services provided by Huvle

###### 2. There were too many written explanations rather than visual explanations of the business

When managing the advertisements, in the existing system, there was difficulty distinguishing advertisement which is from each client. Each client provides various advertisements. Additionally, the resolution sizes of mobile devices vary widely, requiring distinction of data from advertising management by size and client-specific to profit aggregation.
