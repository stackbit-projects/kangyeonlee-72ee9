##### THE PROBLEM

###### 1. Even if it's the same advertisement, the size and number of advertisements are different for each mobile device

###### 2. Difficult to distinguish what size of advertisements from each client request

When managing the advertisements, in the existing system, there was difficulty distinguishing advertisement which is from each client. Each client provides various advertisements. Additionally, the resolution sizes of mobile devices vary widely, requiring distinction of data from advertising management by size and client-specific to profit aggregation.

###### 2. Update the layout improves administrators add each advertisement conveniently

##### THE SOLUTION

### Emphasize a service

I decided to design a site that recognizes Heidi's business at a glance. Focus on visual images for comprehending their platform rather than word explanations.

What if the clients require to question about managing the dashboard, they can upload inquiry on the board page. Then the dashboard admin as a developer can respond immediately.
